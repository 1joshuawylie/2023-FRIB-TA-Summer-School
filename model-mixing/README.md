# Bayesian Model Mixing

_Led by Alexandra Semposki_

In this repo you'll find the hands-on session for the Bayesian model mixing introductory lecture. 

__Materials__: All of the notebooks should be able to clone from GitHub any necessary packages, and as usual import any Python packages that are needed. The `BMM_Masses.csv` file is the data file that will be used for the two challenge projects. 

__Note on Challenge Project #2__: The second challenge project involves running Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, which are in a C++ format wrapped in Python. All that means here is that the simplest way to run that project is to open it in Google Colab, where all of the necessary Ubuntu packages will already be available. This avoids many headaches trying to make it work on GitHub's codespaces. 

To run that challenge, follow the steps below:
1. Download the notebook inside of the 'Challenge_Project_2' folder in this repo. 
2. Save the notebook to your Google Drive. You can also open it in Colab but it will not save when you exit, so if you want to save your work, first upload the notebook to your Drive and open it in Colab from there.
3. Run the notebook on Colab! The BMM_Masses.csv file will be pulled in from the GitHub raw URL, so no need to worry about uploading it.
